# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku

## Things to include in your README

* Cole Gillespie
* Complete
* Compilation and execution instructions
  * `gcc -o piku piku.s` or `make`
  * `./piku`
* An example README would be nice, I'm not sure what format is expected.

These README files have a fairly rich _Markdown_ environment. You should use
markdown syntax to format your README files in such a way that they look
professional, and are easy to read. Use the 
[Markdown Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and
have fun! :octocat:
